# Kahoot-Bot

### An Async Python Bot for Kahoot! (Targeting 2025 Functionality)

## About

This Kahoot-Bot is designed as a modern, asynchronous, and easy-to-use bot for interacting with Kahoot! games. Built with Python. It leverages asynchronous programming to efficiently handle joining ad interacting multiple bots to a game session. The project aims to provide a working solution for demonstration and educational purposes. It is incredibly easy to use being open-source AND including providing compiled executables for platforms like Windows.

**Kahoot!** is a Norwegian online game-based learning platform. It has learning games, also known as "kahoots", which are user-generated multiple-choice quizzes that can be accessed via a web browser or the Kahoot! app.


## Features

*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Built using Python's `asyncio` for high concurrency and efficient handling of multiple bot instances.
*   **Easy to Use:** Designed with simplicity in mind, aiming for straightforward setup and execution.
*   **Python-Based:** Written entirely in Python, making the source code accessible and understandable (subject to the disclaimer).
*   **Executable Provided:** Offers compiled executables (starting with Windows) for users who prefer not to manage Python environments.
*   **Modern Approach:** Developed with contemporary Python practices and libraries.
*   **Joins Kahoot! Games:** Core functionality to connect multiple bots to a specified Kahoot! game PIN including choosing random answers.

*Note: Due to the dynamic nature of online platforms like Kahoot!, continuous maintenance may be required to ensure full functionality. The "2025 working" aspect represents an ongoing goal for compatibility.*
